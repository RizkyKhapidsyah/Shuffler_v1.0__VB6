To play music, just add a music.wav file to the shuffler directory, the music i had was too large to upload

the file that i save to the windows/system directory is the high-score file, i do that to prevent users of the .exe file manipulating the scores, next time i will use an encryption method but this was put together in just a few hours

HAVE FUN!!
